## 📥 Download Binaries

### https://github.com/nextcloud-releases/talk-desktop/releases

## 🏗️ Prerequisites

- [Nextcloud Server](https://github.com/nextcloud/server) version 27 or higher.
- [Nextcloud Talk](https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed) version 17 or higher.

## 👾 Drawbacks

## 👥 Multi-account

Full multi-account currently [is not currently supported](https://github.com/nextcloud/talk-desktop/issues/7).

However, using portable `zip` distribution, you can have several Nextcloud Talk instances run simultaneously. Just rename the executable from default  `Nextcloud Talk` to a custom name. For example:

```
/path/to/apps/
├── home-apps/
│   └── Nextcloud Talk/
│       ├── ...
│       ├── Nextcloud Talk (Home).exe
│       └── ...
└── work-apps/
    └── Nextcloud Talk/
        ├── ...
        ├── Nextcloud Talk (Work).exe
        └── ...
```

## 🧑‍💻 Development Setup

### Initial setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm ci

# Make .env file
cp .env.example .env

# Don't forget to configure ENV variables! 
```

Nextcloud Talk Desktop requires [Nextcloud Talk source code](https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed).

#### No `nextcloud/spreed` is cloned?

Clone `nextcloud/spreed` and install dependencies:

```bash
# Clone in the repository root
git clone https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed

# Install dependencies
cd ./spreed/
npm ci

# Don't forget to return back
cd ../
```

#### `nextcloud/spreed` is already cloned?

Set `TALK_PATH` ENV variable or edit `.env` file:
 ```dotenv
TALK_PATH=/path/to/nextcloud-dev/apps/spreed/
 ```

# Start development server
npm start
```
