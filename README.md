# 🖥️ Nextcloud Talk Desktop 💬

[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/nextcloud/talk-desktop)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/nextcloud/talk-desktop)

> Nextcloud Talk Desktop client based on Nextcloud Talk web application bundling ✨

## 📥 Download Binaries

### https://github.com/nextcloud-releases/talk-desktop/releases

## 🏗️ Prerequisites

- [Nextcloud Server](https://github.com/nextcloud/server) version 27 or higher.
- [Nextcloud Talk](https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed) version 17 or higher.

## 👾 Drawbacks

- Currently not supported:
  - Search ([#30](https://github.com/nextcloud/talk-desktop/issues/30))
  - Untrusted certificate on Linux ([#23](https://github.com/nextcloud/talk-desktop/issues/23))
  - Dark/light theme ([#17](https://github.com/nextcloud/talk-desktop/issues/17))
- Works with limitations:
  - File Viewer — only images and videos

## 👥 Multi-account

Full multi-account currently [is not currently supported](https://github.com/nextcloud/talk-desktop/issues/7).

However, using portable `zip` distribution, you can have several Nextcloud Talk instances run simultaneously. Just rename the executable from default  `Nextcloud Talk` to a custom name. For example: 

```
/path/to/apps/
├── home-apps/
│   └── Nextcloud Talk/
│       ├── ...
│       ├── Nextcloud Talk (Home).exe
│       └── ...
└── work-apps/
    └── Nextcloud Talk/
        ├── ...
        ├── Nextcloud Talk (Work).exe
        └── ...
```

## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Initial setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm ci

# Make .env file
cp .env.example .env

# Don't forget to configure ENV variables! 
```

Nextcloud Talk Desktop requires [Nextcloud Talk source code](https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed).

#### No `nextcloud/spreed` is cloned?

Clone `nextcloud/spreed` and install dependencies:

```bash
# Clone in the repository root
git clone https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed

# Install dependencies
cd ./spreed/
npm ci

# Don't forget to return back
cd ../
```

#### `nextcloud/spreed` is already cloned?

Set `TALK_PATH` ENV variable or edit `.env` file:
 ```dotenv
TALK_PATH=/path/to/nextcloud-dev/apps/spreed/
 ```

## 🧑‍💻 Development

### Start development server in Electron

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Build binaries for production

```bash
# 🖥️ Current platform and architecture
npm run build

# 🐧 Linux (x64)
npm run build:linux

# 🍏 macOS (universal)
npm run build:mac
# 🍏 macOS (separate x64 and arm64)
npm run build:mac:x64
npm run build:mac:arm64

# 🪟 Windows (win32-x64)
npm run build:windows
```

Notes:
- **General recommendation is to always build binaries on the same platform**
- Building Windows binaries on Linux/Mac requires Wine
- Building Mac binaries on Windows is not supported
- Building Linux binaries on Windows is not supported for some Linux distributions

### Maintenance

#### Generating icons

After changing source icons, to generate icons in different sizes and formats, run:

```bash
npm run generate-icons
```

## 📦 Packaging distributions

```bash
# 🐧 Linux (x64)
npm run package:linux

# 🍏 macOS (universal)
npm run package:mac
# 🍏 macOS (separate x64 and arm64)
npm run package:mac:arm64
npm run package:mac:x64

# 🪟 Windows (win32-x64)
npm run package:windows
```
